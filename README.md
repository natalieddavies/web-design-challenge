# WEB DESIGN

I have created a website using the data created in the Matplotlib challenge (https://github.com/natalieddavies/matplotlib-challenge). We were meant to use the WeatherData, but it was an optional bonus to use a dataset of our choice. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matplotlib challenge so I decided to use that data.

## Dashboard

For this task I will be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. 

In building this dashboard, I'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Details

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualisation pages each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
   
The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries).

Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
